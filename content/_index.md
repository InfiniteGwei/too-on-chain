# Like DeFi boys, but cuter ðŸŽ€

Too on-chain is a casual collective comprised of [Reka](https://twitter.com/reka_eth), [LDF](http://twitter.com/parkerjayp), [Parker](http://twitter.com/parkerjayp), and [Emily](https://twitter.com/emilyxlai). 

We are on a quest to be extremely on-chain this cycle and spread actionable alpha like Covid-19 (we're only half joking ðŸ˜…)

Expect step-by-step guides on airdrop farming, LP'ing, trading and more.

*Disclaimer: this is not financial advice. this core is all for fun and learning, holding each othersâ€™ hands, making swaps on rare chains, and claiming our bags (so we can buy cuter bags). we operate as a friend group and private chat.*
