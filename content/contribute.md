There are four key ways you can contribute to Too On-Chain. 

We explain them below ⤵️

### 1. Content Creation

The most straightforward way to contribute is by helping us create these guides! 

At any given point in time, there are several WIP posts as well as ideas/ecosystem explorations that should be in here.

You can take a look at the [backlog](https://infinitegwei.github.io/too-on-chain/backlog) or reach out to our [members](https://infinitegwei.github.io/too-on-chain/members) and offer help with their WIP posts.

### 2. Creating Hype

Content creation not your jam? No worries!

There's always space for folks who help us spread the word and grow our community.

Get started by sharing [this post](https://x.com/emilyxlai/status/1775154394100539501?s=20) or [this post](https://x.com/parkerjayp/status/1768669382111064455?s=20) with your followers and friends!

### 3. Meta Contributions

This is catch-all category for everything that isn't content creation or creating hype.

This means tasks like managing/updating this website, making sure contributors have a smooth experience and holding spaces for conversations, come under this category.

There are no specific guidelines or rules here, so if you feel you can make a meta contribution, [do tell one of us](https://infinitegwei.github.io/too-on-chain/members)!
