💡 **[Monad](https://linktr.ee/monad_xyz) is an advanced L1 smart contract platform**, recently securing a $19 million seed round. It claims to offer remarkable throughput of 10k tps through optimized consensus and execution methods. Monad aims to be 1kx faster than Ethereum. $19m Seed announced 2/14/24, led by Framework, Shima, Placeholder, Lemnis, and more.

### Airdrop Eligibility (MVP)

**In order to qualify for the Monad airdrop, you must:**

- **(1) Complete identity verification on the MONAD platform.**
    - **Step 1:** Go to Monad homepage, click ‘Join Community’. You will be re-directed to Discord. Sign in if you’re not signed in already.
    - **Step 2:** Agree to the Monad Discord Terms & Conditions.
    - **Step 3:** Click “Verify”.
    - **Step 4:** Now, you should have access to the “newbie-chat” channel in Discord. All other channels are locked until you’ve engaged enough to access other channels.
- **(2) Hold platform tokens and all activities in a compatible wallet during the MONAD snapshot period.**
    - *Note: As of now, I can’t seem to find a legit MONAD token. Found the info in (2) online from an in-depth source but not exactly sure what they’re referencing here. Any ideas … ? Don’t think it’s too relevant for now. (3/5/24).*

**Meeting the eligibility criteria is the first step to claiming your portion of the MONAD token distribution.**

### How do I claim my airdrop? (Airdrop Printer go Brrr)

- **Participants can check if they meet the MONAD airdrop eligibility (and claim their airdrop, when it is released) via the [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/hub/airdrops) website.**
    - **Note:** Based on my research thus far, it appears users should be able to identify and claim their Monad airdrop (once it is released) via the ‘Airdrop’ tab/page on **[DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/hub/airdrops).**

### Wen TGE (Token Generation Event)?

#### When is $MONAD set to go live?

- **While our research was inconclusive in attempting to identify an official launch/TGE date for $MONAD, the general consensus (within the bounds of contextual speculation) is that the token is set to launch somewhere between mid to late 2024 (Q3’24 or Q4’24).**
    - Our findings and determinations here are subject to change and will be updated continuously with the surfacing and realization of new information.

## Just remember: The higher your Discord engagement, the greater your Airdrop Eligibility.

### The Monad ‘Social Credit Score’

Monad opened **[their Discord](https://discord.gg/monad)** and has launched The Monad Social Credit Score. Your Social Score reflects your contribution to society *(Parker: wtf?)*.

### How to earn ‘Monad Social Score’:

1. **Before starting to engage with inhibition in the Monad Discord, you are constrained to a chat for newcomers. This is the “newbie-chat”**. You need to gain access to all chats in order to progress further. Presumably, all other channels are locked until you’ve “engaged” enough in the newbie channel to unlock other channels.
2. **Engage in this chat as much as you can.** Engagement is likely measured by exchange and volume of messages, reactions, utilization of the Discord ‘Roles’ feature, and more (see below).

**Remember, the higher your ‘Monad Social Score’, the greater likelihood for airdrop eligibility.** How is this ‘Monad Social Score’ ranked and measured, you ask? It corresponds directly to *Discord ‘Roles’ and XP.*

### How to Farm? Engage on Discord.

***Monad Social Score as mapped to the hierarchy of Discord Roles (and XP):*** 

1. **Discord XP** - you can earn it by participating in chat, asking questions before AMA sessions, winning in poker tournaments, or other activities.
2. **Roles** - obtaining roles is one of the main activities we'll be doing. There are several roles:
- **Nads** - for reaching level 6 in Discord XP.
- **Monvangelist** - this role can be obtained for writing threads, articles, or other contributions to the project.
- **Quant** - can be obtained for writing interesting topics about DeFi, trading, technology, or NFTs.
- **Monartist & Monvideo** - for creators of video-photo content, stickers, and so on.
- **MonOG** - a very rare role that only long-term contributors can obtain.
- **Running Hot** - the role can be obtained if you are nominated by another active member.
- **Pioneer** - could be obtained when Discord was closed.

### Alt Farming Techniques? Use Pyth! (?)

[https://x.com/0xkongy/status/1749111160639820070?s=46&t=1BzoU9rmPMtyYcgfObzT8w](https://x.com/0xkongy/status/1749111160639820070?s=46&t=1BzoU9rmPMtyYcgfObzT8w)

- **Note:** Some believe that using Pyth, an oracle that serves the Monad L1 Blockchain, may increase airdrop eligibility for $MONAD.
    - **See above Tweet for context w/ a step-by-step ‘how-to’ re: farming Pyth.**
