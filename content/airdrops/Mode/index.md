Start here: [https://ref.mode.network/YB5duY](https://ref.mode.network/YB5duY) 

You'll see what you already qualify for based on your wallet, then bridge some assets and start earning points by doing quests.

### PLAY WITH TESTNET

There are faucets here as well for the testnet, claim your testnet tokens:

- Smoothest: [https://www.l2faucet.com/mode](https://www.l2faucet.com/mode) /24 hrs
- [https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)

With the Sepolia testnet ETH you are claiming from the faucets, move them over to MODE here: 

[https://bridge.mode.network/](https://bridge.mode.network/)

### BRIDGE TO MODE
Move assets from other chains to MODE:  [https://app.mode.network](https://app.mode.network/)

This is real money not testnet so it's going to cost you gas, supposed to be safe to even park some of your ETH here, calculate in the usual smart contract risks.
Bridge at least $100-200 for transactions and later tasks.

### PLAY WITH THE ECOSYSTEM

- [ ]  Joined Sunrise
- [ ]  Bridged from mainnet ([https://app.mode.network](https://app.mode.network/))
- [ ]  Register a Domain: around $50 [https://space.id](https://space.id/)
- [ ]  Swap on [https://app.kim.exchange/swap](https://app.kim.exchange/swap) since Mode is not ETH mainnet this will virtually be free
- [ ]  Swap on [https://supswap.xyz/](https://supswap.xyz/)
- [ ]  Deploying smart contracts: [https://minter.merkly.com/deploy/empty](https://minter.merkly.com/deploy/empty)

I am exploring the other ones if they are safe and fun and valuable to do.
