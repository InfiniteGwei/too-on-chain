Insane yields, it's worth it for that too.

Ethena is a hot new stablecoin effort:

START HERE:

1. Go to: [app.ethena.fi/join/cohn3](http://app.ethena.fi/join/cohn3)
2. Go to ‚Äò**Buy**‚Äô tab and buy USDe 
for this you will need USDC on mainnet, use [https://jumper.exchange](https://jumper.exchange/?fromChain=42161&fromToken=0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831&toChain=1&toToken=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48) to swap if you need.
3. Go to ‚Äò**Liquidity**‚Äô tab, select a pool to LP and proceed to Curve to do so
4. Provide liquidity in Curve to receive LP token
5. Bring LP token to Ethena ‚Äò**Liquidity**‚Äô page and¬†**lock**¬†LP token
6. Receive shards

**USDe** = Ethena‚Äôs synthetic dollar that takes on forms of staked ETH and ETH as backing, combined with short ETH hedges on exchanges to achieve a delta neutral approximate dollar position. This token will be the focal point of liquidity provision in AMMs and CEX orderbooks.

**sUSDe** = the token representing staked USDe. sUSDe accrues value from the system‚Äôs underlying staked ETH which backs USDe, as well as the funding rate earned from the short ETH position, on a ‚Äútotal system‚Äù basis. Or in other words, some portion of the unstaked USDe value accrual may flow into the sUSDe token. USDe that is staked is not rehypothecated or otherwise utilized to independently generate the value accrual for sUSDe.

sUSDe is a reward-bearing token (like cbETH or sDAI, as opposed to, for example stETH, which is rebasing), which means that its price increases over time to reflect value accrual within the staking smart contract.
